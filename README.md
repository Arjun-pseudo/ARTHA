# Artha: Redefining Decentralized Value

## Welcome to Artha
Artha is a decentralized virtual economy platform that integrates **mathematics**, **cryptography**, and **real-world economic models** to create a scalable, secure, and stable ecosystem for transacting and storing value. The system is built on innovative concepts such as:

- **Proof of Value (PoV):** Validates network activity using bandwidth, data throughput, and internet metrics as indicators of value.
- **Economic Proof of Work (ePoW):** Links real-time economic metrics to stabilize and validate transactions.
- **Orbital Chain Technology:** A unique approach using circular permutations and orbit-based structures for data encoding, transaction validation, and scalability.

## Key Features
1. **Stability:** Prevents wild fluctuations in value by integrating market-specific mechanisms.
2. **Scalability:** Uses geometric models and circular permutations to grow dynamically.
3. **Integration:** Bridges real-world economic activity with virtual value for enhanced reliability.
4. **Custom Time System:** Embeds Artha-specific time duration cycles for uniformity.

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- **Mathematical Models:** Detailed calculations for orbit areas, circular permutations, and economic proofs.
- **Codebase:** Modular components for creating and managing Orbital Chains.
- **Documentation:** Step-by-step guides and theoretical insights into Artha's architecture.
- **Open Issues:** Areas where contributors can actively engage to refine the platform.

## How to Contribute
Weâ€™re actively seeking:
- **Developers** to expand the Orbital Chain library and implement algorithms.
- **Mathematicians** to refine and validate geometric and permutation models.
- **Economists** to ensure the system reflects real-world market dynamics.
- **Blockchain Experts** to enhance transaction security and scalability.
